### _Standardizing Change: Communicating Product Evolution with Precision._

## 📌 Philosophy

# 

I treat Release Notes as a **Product Feature**, not an afterthought. My goal is to bridge the gap between "Code Commits" and "User Understanding." I focus on:

*   **Impact-First Reporting:** Highlighting what the user _actually_ needs to do (e.g., Upgrade, Fix, or Migration).
    
*   **Technical Accuracy:** Translating complex security fixes (EDR/XDR) into actionable intelligence.
    
*   **Developer Empathy:** Documenting "Breaking Changes" clearly to minimize integration friction.

## 🛠 The "Release Stack"

# 

I use a structured system to ensure no detail is missed during a deployment:

*   **Versioning:** Strict adherence to **SemVer (Semantic Versioning)**.
    
*   **Automation:** Leveraging GitHub Actions to pull "Changelogs" from tagged PRs.
    
*   **Categorization:** Breaking Changes, New Features, Bug Fixes, and Security Advisories.
