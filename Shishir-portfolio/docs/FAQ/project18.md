# Documentation & User Onboarding

### Purpose of the Issue


The primary goal of this task was to bridge the information gap for new users interacting with the **TileSpace** environment. As the application features specific custom logic—such as **grid capacity tiers** and **hidden hover zones**—there was a clear need for a centralized resource to explain these mechanics. Without this, users might struggle to navigate the more advanced technical specifications of the tool.

### How the Solution Solves the Issue


The solution involved a two-pronged approach to improve project discoverability and user self-service:

*   **Synthesized Knowledge:** I created a comprehensive `FAQ.md` by translating complex technical specifications into 10+ accessible Q&A pairs. This covers critical features like Quick Capture ($Cmd+K$), Grid Behavior, and Overview Mode.
    
*   **Improved Navigation:** I updated the root `README.md` to include direct links to the new documentation. This ensures that a user's first point of contact with the repository immediately directs them to the help they need, reducing the learning curve.
