# Modern Ontology Editor FAQ & Wiki

## Purpose of Issue


The project lacked a centralized location for addressing common user hurdles, leading to repetitive queries regarding setup and compatibility. Specifically, the goals were:

*   **User Onboarding:** To streamline the initial experience for new users.
    
*   **Knowledge Consolidation:** To synthesize information buried in closed issues and project specifications into a readable format.
    
*   **Technical Troubleshooting:** To document known edge cases, such as **Windows filename compatibility** and **environment variable configuration**, which had previously caused friction for developers.
    

## How the Solution Solves the Issue


The solution provides a structured documentation layer that acts as the "first line of defense" for user support:

*   **Centralized FAQ:** Created a comprehensive `FAQ.md` featuring over 20 entries categorized by General, Technical, Features, and Troubleshooting.
    
*   **Improved Discoverability:** Integrated the FAQ directly into the `README.md`, ensuring that documentation is the first thing a user sees when landing on the repository.
    
*   **Foundation for Wiki:** Established the base structure for the project’s official Wiki, allowing for scalable documentation as the editor grows.
    
*   **Proactive Support:** By addressing environment setup issues (derived from historical repository data) directly in the FAQ, the solution reduces the volume of new issues created for known problems.
