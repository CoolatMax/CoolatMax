## Hi, I’m Shishir Shreedhar Tambe 👋

I’m a **technical writer working in cybersecurity**, documenting enterprise-grade products like **eScan EDR, eScan XDR, and eScan EMM** at **Microworld Security Software Solutions**.

I specialize in translating complex security systems—endpoint detection, extended detection, device management, workflows, and policies—into documentation that engineers, security teams, and enterprise users can operate with confidence.

I come from an engineering background, which means I don’t just describe features—I explain **systems, intent, and impact**.

> Good documentation isn’t support material.  
> It’s part of the product.

## What I work on

- 📘 **Product Documentation**: user guides, admin manuals, workflows, SOPs for security products  
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity Docs**: EDR/XDR concepts, policies, configurations, alerts, response flows  
- ⚙️ **Docs-as-Code**: Markdown, GitHub, versioned documentation, CI-friendly workflows  
- 🧠 **Systems Thinking**: explaining how components interact, not just where buttons are

## Proof of work 

- 🧾 Actively documenting **production cybersecurity products** (EDR, XDR, EMM)  
- ✍️ Writing on **Medium & Hashnode** about engineering, documentation, and systems thinking  
- 📂 Documentation samples maintained on GitHub — **structured, versioned, reviewable**
